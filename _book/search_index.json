Items commonly associated with CPU mode of execution include:\n\nthe subset of instructions that are valid\nthe size of data items \nthe region of memory that can be accessed\nthe functional units that are available\nthe amount of privilege\n\nModes of Execution\nThere are two ways the CPU can change execution modes:\n\nAutomatic: initiated by hardware, like an I/O device\nManual: mode changes under a running program, like the operating system\n\nThree different mechanism are used to change modes:\n\nCPU includes an instruction to set the current mode\nCPU contains a special-purpose mode register to control the mode (responds to the store command by changing the mode)\nthe side-effect of another instruction can change the mode (e.g. an app makes an operating system call by using an instruction from a CPU instruction set)\n\nPrivilege and Protection\nCPUs can prevent unintentional or malicious changes with different levels of privilege that limit the operations that are allowed. CPUs that run apps have at least two levels of protection. The operating system has the highest privilege, and apps run with limited privilege.\nMicrocode\nThe CPU is built in two pieces:\n\nmicrocontroller: a small, fast processor \nmicrocode: software for the microcontroller to implement the CPU instruction set (macro instruction set)\n\n\n(Figure 8.3 from the Essentials of Computer Architecture, 2nd Edition textbook by Douglas E. Comer)\nThe CPU decodes a macro instruction during instruction execution, then invokes the microcode that corresponds to the instruction. Macro and micro architectures can differ.\n\n(Figure 8.4 from the Essentials of Computer Architecture, 2nd Edition textbook by Douglas E. Comer)\nMicrocode defines all aspects of the macro system, including the format of macro instructions. It also defines the form and encoding of each operand. \nThree advantages of using microcode:\n\nhigher level abstraction \nbuilding microcode takes less time than building circuits (also less prone to errors)\nnew versions of CPU can be created faster since microcode is easier to change than hardware\n\nDisadvantages of using microcode:\n\nmore overhead than implementing hardware: macro instructions take up multiple clock cycles\nexecuting multiple micro instructions for each macro instruction requires the microcontroller to run faster than the CPU\ncost of macro instruction relies on the micro instruction set\n\nVertical Microcode\nA microcontroller needs to interacts with hardware components in the CPU like \n\naccessing the ALU \nstoring results in general purpose registers, and\ncoordination with other hardware units like memory\n\nA microcontroller has a vertical architecture if it consists of a RISC processor. \nAdvantages\n\none micro instruction is executed at a time for vertical microcode, which is the software that runs on the microcontroller \nvertical microcode's interface is easy for programmers to understand: uses conventional looking code\n\nDisadvantages\n\nhardware must operate at high speeds since only one micro instruction is executed at a time\ncannot utilize the parallelism of the underlying hardware\n\nHorizontal Microcode\nHorizontal microcode allows hardware to run faster; however, it's more difficult to program.\nField-programmable gate array (FPGA)\n"}}}
