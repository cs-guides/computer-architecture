performing calculations, controlling I/O, and telling other processors what to do.\nModern CPUs are very complex, containing billions of transistors to achieve high performance.\n\nMultiple cores\nMultiple roles\nProtection and Privilege\nHardware Priorities\nGenerality\nData size\nHigh speed\n\nThe hardware for CPUs have different modes of execution to handle complex operations and features. Items commonly associated with CPU mode of execution include:\n\nthe subset of instructions that are valid\nthe size of data items \nthe region of memory that can be accessed\nthe functional units that are available\nthe amount of privilege\n\nThere are two ways the CPU can change execution modes:\n\nAutomatic: initiated by hardware, like an I/O device\nManual: mode changes under a running program, like the operating system\n\nThree different mechanism are used to change modes:\n\nCPU includes an instruction to set the current mode\nCPU contains a special-purpose mode register to control the mode (responds to the store command by changing the mode)\nthe side-effect of another instruction can change the mode (e.g. an app makes an operating system call by using an instruction from a CPU instruction set)\n\nCPUs can prevent unintentional or malicious changes with different levels of privilege that limit the operations that are allowed. CPUs that run apps have at least two levels of protection. The operating system has the highest privilege, and apps run with limited privilege.\n"}}}
