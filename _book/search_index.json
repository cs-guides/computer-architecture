Items commonly associated with CPU mode of execution include:\n\nthe subset of instructions that are valid\nthe size of data items \nthe region of memory that can be accessed\nthe functional units that are available\nthe amount of privilege\n\nModes of Execution\nThere are two ways the CPU can change execution modes:\n\nAutomatic: initiated by hardware, like an I/O device\nManual: mode changes under a running program, like the operating system\n\nThree different mechanism are used to change modes:\n\nCPU includes an instruction to set the current mode\nCPU contains a special-purpose mode register to control the mode (responds to the store command by changing the mode)\nthe side-effect of another instruction can change the mode (e.g. an app makes an operating system call by using an instruction from a CPU instruction set)\n\nPrivilege and Protection\nCPUs can prevent unintentional or malicious changes with different levels of privilege that limit the operations that are allowed. CPUs that run apps have at least two levels of protection. The operating system has the highest privilege, and apps run with limited privilege.\nMicrocode\nThe CPU is built in two pieces:\n\nmicrocontroller: a small, fast processor \nmicrocode: software for the microcontroller to implement the CPU instruction set (macro instruction set)\n\n\n(Figure 8.3 from the Essentials of Computer Architecture, 2nd Edition textbook by Douglas E. Comer)\nThe CPU decodes a macro instruction during instruction execution, then invokes the microcode that corresponds to the instruction. Macro and micro architectures can differ.\n\n(Figure 8.4 from the Essentials of Computer Architecture, 2nd Edition textbook by Douglas E. Comer)\nMicrocode defines all aspects of the macro system, including the format of macro instructions. It also defines the form and encoding of each operand. \nThree advantages of using microcode:\n\nhigher level abstraction \nbuilding microcode takes less time than building circuits (also less prone to errors)\nnew versions of CPU can be created faster since microcode is easier to change than hardware\n\nDisadvantages of using microcode:\n\nmore overhead than implementing hardware: macro instructions take up multiple clock cycles\nexecuting multiple micro instructions for each macro instruction requires the microcontroller to run faster than the CPU\ncost of macro instruction relies on the micro instruction set\n\nVertical Microcode\nA microcontroller needs to interacts with hardware components in the CPU like \n\naccessing the ALU \nstoring results in general purpose registers, and\ncoordination with other hardware units like memory\n\nA microcontroller has a vertical architecture if it consists of a RISC processor. \nAdvantages\n\none micro instruction is executed at a time for vertical microcode, which is the software that runs on the microcontroller \nvertical microcode's interface is easy for programmers to understand: uses conventional looking code\n\nDisadvantages\n\nhardware must operate at high speeds since only one micro instruction is executed at a time\ncannot utilize the parallelism of the underlying hardware\n\nHorizontal Microcode\nHorizontal microcode allows hardware to run faster; however, it's more difficult to program.\nField-programmable gate array (FPGA)\n"},"docs/processors/assembly-languages.html":{"url":"docs/processors/assembly-languages.html","title":"Assembly Languages","keywords":"","body":"Assembly Languages\nHigh-Level Language (HLL) has these characteristics:\n\none-to-many translation: \neach statement corresponds to multiple machine instructions\n\n\nhardware independent: \nprogrammers don't need to know details about underlying hardware\n\n\napplication orientated: \nallows programmers to create application programs\nHHL includes I/O facilities and allow programmers to define complex data objects\n\n\ngeneral-purpose: \nnot restricted to a specific task\n\n\npowerful abstractions: \nallows programmers to express complex tasks \n\n\n\nLow-Level Language has these characteristics:\n\none-to-one translation: \neach statement corresponds to one instruction in the underlying processor\n\n\nhardware dependence: \nlow-level language created for one type of processor can't be used with another type of processor \n\n\nsystems programming orientation:\nallows programmers to create software that can directly control the hardware\n\n\nspecial-purpose: \nlow-level language is only used when control and efficiency is needed\n\n\nfew abstractions:\ndoes not provide complex data structures or control statements\n\n\n\nAssembly Language\nAssembly language is a low-level language. Since it uses the instruction set and operands from a specific processor, many assembly languages exist. However, many different assembly languages share the same structure.\nStatement Format\nA single assembly language statement corresponds to one machine instruction. The general format is:\nlabel: opcode operand1, operand2, ...\n\nlabel is used for branching\nopcode specifies one possible instruction, separated by whitespace from other items\noperands are separated by commas \n\nOpcode Names\nAssembly Languages use short abbreviations like add or br (branching) \nCommenting Conventions\nProgrammers often add comments after each line of assembly code to explain the purpose of the statement:\nld r5,r3 # load the address of list into r5\nOperand Order\nOperand order may change between assembly languages. In following statement, the first operand is the target register (the destination register), and the second operand is the source register:\nld r5,r3 # load the address of list into r5\nSome assembly language specify the opposite order, where the target register is on the right:\nld r3,r5 # load the address of list into r5\n"}}}
